<b>What is Core Data ?</b><br/>
Core data is not a database.
It is not even a Object Relational Mapping Framework.
According to the definition in apple documentation “Core Data is a schema driven object graph management and persistence Framework”, which creates a layer between database and user interface.
. <br/><br/>
<b>Why learn Core Data</b><br/>
- Before Core Data developers had to work with SQLite to save and manage data.
- Handling CRUD operations was difficult.
- When using SQLite user was responsible to check if saved data matched the schema.
- Means, we were our own persistence layer.<br/><br/>
<b>Why Use Core Data</b><br/>
- Core Data is supported by apple.
- Using Core Data hides the SQLite and make CRUD operations much easier.
- To use core data it is not necessary that one must know SQL.<br/><br/>
<b>Storage Options</b><br/>
We have different options when it comes to storing and managing data,  which are as following.<br/>
- In-memory 
- XML (only for MAC OS X)
- Binary
- Plists
- Sqlite<br/><br/>
